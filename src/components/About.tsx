          Hello World!, I'm Punya! A CS Grad passionate about creating high-performance,
          user-centric software solutions with intuitive and engaging designs. I am
          building impactful solutions and contributing to the developer community.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js,
          React, TypeScript, and modern front-end technologies. I also am heavily leaned
          towards the world of AI and its Applications and built some passion projects
          around it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Beyond work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality
          through personal projects (A Lot).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me diving into classic literature, crafting
          pixel-perfect designs in Figma, or analyzing tech references in movies and shows.
          I'm always open to collaborating on open-source projects and exploring new
          opportunities.
        </p>
