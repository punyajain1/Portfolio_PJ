          Hello World!, I'm Punya! A CS Grad passionate about creating high-performance,
          user-centric software solutions with intuitive and engaging designs. I am
          building impactful solutions and contributing to the developer community.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js,
          React, TypeScript, and modern front-end and back-end technologies. I also am heavily leaned
          towards the world of AI and its Applications and built some passion projects
          around it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Beyond work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality
          through personal projects (A Lot).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me doing random stuff like trying out new recipes, or just going out to touch grass and reset my brain.
          I'm always open to collaborating on open-source projects and exploring new
          opportunities.
        </p>

          Let's connect and collaborate to build something amazing together!
