          Hello World!, I&apos;m Punya! A CS Grad passionate about creating high-performance,
          user-centric software solutions with intuitive and engaging designs. I am
          building impactful solutions and contributing to the developer community.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I am a Full-Stack Developer specializing in building scalable web and mobile applications. 
          My expertise includes Next.js, TypeScript, the MERN stack, as well as both SQL and NoSQL databases, 
          with a strong focus on backend development. I am also deeply passionate about Artificial Intelligence and have experience building AI agents and applications through various projects and explorations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Beyond work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality
          through personal projects (A Lot).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll probably find me doing random stuff like trying out new recipes, or just going out to touch grass and reset my brain.
          I&apos;m always open to collaborating on open-source projects and exploring new
          opportunities.
        </p>
